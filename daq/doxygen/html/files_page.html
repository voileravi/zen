</pre></div><ul>
<li>(1) Every QP version, such as QP/C, QP/C++, ir QP-nano resides in the separate directory branch, called henceforth QP Root Directory. The essential element of the design is that the QP Root Directory can be "plugged into" any branch of a hierarchical file system and you can move the QP Root Directory around, or even have multiple versions of the QP Root Directories. You can also freely choose the name of the QP Root Directory, although I recommend the directory names <code>qpc\</code> for QP/C and <code>qpcpp\</code> for QP/C++. The ability to relocate the QP Root Directory means that only relative paths should be used in the Makefiles, build scripts, workspaces, or project files.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(2) The file qpc.chm contains the "QP/C Reference Manual" in CHM format.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(3) The <code>doxygen\</code> directory contains this "QP/C Reference Manual" generated with the Doxygen utility.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(4) The <code>html\</code> subdirectory contains this HTML verions of the "QP/C
Reference Manual". In particular, the file index.html is the index page of the Manual.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(5) The <code>examples\</code> directory contains the application examples that are included in the standard QP/C distribution. The structure of the <code>examples\</code> (and also <code>ports\</code> directory) is the most complicated because of the large number of choices available, such as CPU architectures, compilers, operating systems, and compiler options. Each of those choices is represented as a separate level of nesting in a hierarchical directory tree, so that each dimension in the multi-dimensional space of options can be extended independently from the others. Also, the directory branch for each QP port is individually customizable, so each branch can represent only choices relevant for a given CPU, operating system, compiler, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(6) The CPU architecture is placed as the first level of nesting within the <code>examples\</code> directory. Examples of CPU architectures are: 80x86, ARM, ARM Cortex, AVR, MSP430, M16C, etc. Please note that a separate directory is needed whenever the CPU architecture is significantly different. For example, even though the traditional ARM and the new ARM Cortex are related, the differences are significant enough to require a separate directory branch for ARM and ARM Cortex.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(7) The second level of nesting, under the CPU architecture, is the operating system used. For example, in the 80x86 architecture, QP can operate under DOS (with the "vanilla" cooperative kernel), under the QK preemptive kernel, under the MicroC/OS-II RTOS, or under Linux (and perhaps other OSs, such as Win32).</li>
</ul>
<dl class="note"><dt><b>Note:</b></dt><dd>The ordering of directory levels reflects the embedded focus in the QP design. In most standalone QF applications the CPU architecture is typically more important than the RTOS/OS. For general-purpose operating systems, such as Linux, the reversed order (operating system at a higher level than the CPU architecture) would perhaps feel more natural.</dd></dl>
<ul>
<li>(8) The next level of nesting, under each operating system directory, is the directory for the compiler used. For example, the DOS port can be compiled with the Open Watcom or perhaps with Borland C++. Similarly, the port to ARM Cortex with QK kernel can be compiled with the IAR, RealView, or GNU compilers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(9) In some ports, the compiler can emit code for various modes of the CPU. For example, a compiler for 80x86 under DOS can produce small, compact, large, or huge memory models. These different modes result in incompatible object code, and therefore each of them requires a separate branch. Please note that the compiler options level is optional. For example, the ARM Cortex CPU branch does not need the compiler options level.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(10) Finally, the example application is located in its own directory. For example, the <code>dpp\</code> directory contains the "Dining Philosopher Problem" application example for this particular CPU/Kernel/Compiler/Options combinations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(11) The <code>dpp\dbg\</code> subdirectory contains the object files and the executable for the Debug configuration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(12) The <code>dpp\rel\</code> subdirectory contains the object files and the executable for the Release configuration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(13) The <code>dpp\spy\</code> subdirectory contains the object files and the executable for the Spy configuration (with the <a class="el" href="qs_page.html">QS Software Tracing Instrumentation (Target Component)</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(14) All five state designed patterns described in Chapter 5 of <a class="el" href="index.html#PSiCC2">Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, Second Edition</a> (PSiCC2) are provided.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(15) The directory <code>qk\</code> contains examples for the QK preemptive kernel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(16) The directory <code>ucos2\</code> contains examples for the MicroC/OS-II RTOS.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(17) The directory <code>linux\</code> contains examples for the Linux operating system.</li>
</ul>
<dl class="note"><dt><b>Note:</b></dt><dd>The port to Linux also runs on many POSIX-compliant OSes/RTOSes, such as BSD, Solaris, MacOS X, and QNX.</dd></dl>
<ul>
<li>(18) The Makefile for building POSIX port is provided.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(19) The directory <code>arm-cortex\</code> contains QP examples for ARM Cortex.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(20) The directory <code>include\</code> contains platform-independent header files for QP all components. You need to point your C/C++ compiler to include files from this directory.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(21-24) The platform-independent source code of each QP component is located in the separate directory. The sources files are only needed to re-build QP libraries, but you don't need to include these directories in the compiler's search path to build applications.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(25) The directory <code>ports\</code> contains platform-dependent header files and libraries to be used by QP applications. This directory structure is the most complicated because of the large number of choices available, such as CPU architectures, compilers, operating systems, and compiler options. Each of those choices is represented as a separate level of nesting in a hierarchical directory tree, so that each dimension in the multi-dimensional space of options can be extended independently from the others. Also, the directory branch for each port is individually customizable, so each branch can represent only choices relevant for a given CPU, operating system, compiler, etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(26) The CPU architecture is placed as the first level of nesting within the <code>ports\</code> directory. Examples of CPU architectures are: 80x86, ARM Cortex, ARM, AVR, MSP430, M16C, etc. Please note that a separate directory is needed whenever the CPU architecture is significantly different. For example, even though the traditional ARM and the new ARM Cortex are related, the differences are significant enough to require a separate directory branch for ARM and ARM Cortex.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(27) The second level of nesting, under the CPU architecture, is the operating system used. For example, in the 80x86 architecture, QP can operate under DOS (with the "vanilla" cooperative kernel), under the QK preemptive kernel, under the MicroC/OS-II RTOS, or under Linux (and perhaps other OSs, such as Win32).</li>
</ul>
<dl class="note"><dt><b>Note:</b></dt><dd>The ordering of directory levels reflects the embedded focus in the QP design.

For example, the ARM Cortex CPU branch does not need the compiler options level.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(30) Finally, the QP libraries can be compiled with different compile-time switches and optimization options. For example, the <code>dbg\</code> directory holds the Debug configuration, which contains the symbolic debug information.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(31) Each specific build directory contains the QP library files. The actual library names should comply with the conventions used on a particular platform. For example, on Linux the libraries are typically named <code>libXXX.a</code> (e.g., <code>libqep.a</code>, <code>libqf.a</code>, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(32) The <code>rel\</code> directory holds the Release configuration, which typically does not contain debug information but might use aggressive optimizations for best performance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(33) The standard QP ports often contain a simple <code>make.bat</code> script or a Makefile for building all the QP libraries for the port. You typically can choose the build configuration by providing a target to the make.bat script or to the Makefile. The default target is "dbg". Other possible targets are "rel", and "spy". The following table summarizes the targets accepted by the make.bat scripts or the Makefiles.</li>
</ul>

<li>(34) The <a class="el" href="qep__port_8h.html" title="QEP/C port to QK for a &quot;generic&quot; C compiler.">qep_port.h</a> header file contains platform-specific definitions of macros and typedef's for the QEP component.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(35) The <a class="el" href="qf__port_8h.html" title="QF port to QK for a &quot;generic&quot; C compiler.">qf_port.h</a> header file contains platform-specific definitions of macros and typedef's for the QF component.</li>

<li>(37) The <a class="el" href="qs__port_8h.html" title="QS/C port to QS for a &quot;generic&quot; C compiler.">qs_port.h</a> header file contains platform-specific definitions of macros and typedef's for the QS component.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(38) The subdirectory <code>ucos2.86\</code> contains the headers and object files of MicroC/OS-II v2.86, compiled for 80x86 with the Open Watcom compiler. This directory is provided only to allow you re-building the example applications based on the QF port to MicroC/OS-II. Typically, however, you will need to obtain the MicroC/OS-II source code to re-build it for the actual processor you're using.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(39-40) QP ports to an external RTOS or OS, such as MicroC/OS-II or Linux require some "glue-code" to bolt the QF framework to the external RTOS/OS. This source code is placed in the file qf_port.c in the subdirectory <code>src\</code>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(41) The directory <code>tools\</code> contains host-resident tools used for QP (see qspy_page).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(42) The directory <code>qspy\</code> contains the portable QSPY host utility.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(43) The subdirectory <code>linux\</code> contains QSPY port to Linux.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(44) The <code>Makefile</code> for building Linux QSPY executable is provided.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(45) The subdirectory <code>win32\</code> contains QSPY port to Win32.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(46-48) The Windows version of QSPY can be build with three different compilers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(49) The subdirectory <code>matlab\</code> contains scripts to import QSPY data to MATLAB. You need to place this directory on the MATLAB path to convenietly access the scripts.</li>
