<p>The key events in the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game have been identified in the sequence diagram in <a class="el" href="design.html#F4s1">Figure 4-1</a>. Other events have been invented during the state machine design stage. In any case, you must have noticed that events consist really of two parts. The part of the event called the signal conveys the type of the occurrence (what happened). For example, the <code>TIME_TICK</code> signal conveys the arrival of a time tick, while <code>PLAYER_SHIP_MOVE</code> signal conveys that the player wants to move the Ship. An event can also contain additional quantitative information about the occurrence in form of event parameters. For example, the <code>PLAYER_SHIP_MOVE</code> signal is accompanied by the parameters <code>(x, y)</code> that contain the quantitative information as to where exactly to move the Ship. In QP, events are represented as instances of the <a class="el" href="struct_q_event.html" title="Event structure.">QEvent</a> structure provided by the framework. Specifically, the <a class="el" href="struct_q_event.html" title="Event structure.">QEvent</a> structure contains the member sig, to represent the signal of that event. Event parameters are added in the process of inheritance, as described in the sidebar <a class="el" href="derivation.html">Encapsulation and Single Inheritance in C</a>.</p>

6.1 Enumerating Event Signals and Defining Event Parameters</h2>
<p>Because events are explicitly shared among most of the application components, it is convenient to declare them in the separate header file game.h shown <a class="el" href="events.html#L6s1">Listing 6-1</a>. The explanation section immediately following the listing illuminates the interesting points.</p>

<li>(1) In QP, signals of events are simply enumerated constants. Placing all signals in a single enumeration is particularly convenient to avoid inadvertent overlap in the numerical values of different signals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(2) The application-level signals do not start from zero but rather are offset by the constant <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html#ae35e58b2153d1c63307c068315be9074a6b922ebd3f2429b5b5e7b411675fda06">Q_USER_SIG</a>. This is because QP reserves the lowest few signals for the internal use and provides the constant <a class="el" href="qep_8h.html#ae35e58b2153d1c63307c068315be9074a6b922ebd3f2429b5b5e7b411675fda06">Q_USER_SIG</a> as an offset from which user-level signals can start. Please also note that by convention, I attach the suffix <code>_SIG</code> to all signals so that I can easily distinguish signals from other constants. I drop the suffix <code>_SIG</code> in the state diagrams to reduce the clutter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(3) The constant <code>MAX_PUB_SIG</code> delimits the published signals from the rest. The publish-subscribe event delivery mechanism consumes some RAM, which is proportional to the number of published signals. I save some RAM by providing the lower limit of published signals to QP (<code>MAX_PUB_SIG</code>) rather than maximum of all signals used in the application. (See also <a class="el" href="main_function.html#L3s1">Listing 3-1</a>(9)).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(4) The last enumeration <code>MAX_SIG</code> indicates the maximum of all signals used in the application.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(5) The event structure <code>ObjectPosEvt</code> defines a "class" of events that convey the object's position on the display in the event parameters.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(6) The structure <code>ObjectPosEvt</code> derives from the base structure <a class="el" href="struct_q_event.html" title="Event structure.">QEvent</a>, as explained in the sidebar <a class="el" href="derivation.html">Encapsulation and Single Inheritance in C</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(7-8) The structure <code>ObjectPosEvt</code> adds parameters <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, which are coordinates of the object on the display.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(9-11) These global pointers represent active objects in the application and are used for posting events directly to active objects. Because the pointers can be initialized at compile time, I like to declare them const, sot that they can be placed in ROM. The active object pointers are "opaque", because they cannot access the whole active object, but only the part inherited from the <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html" title="Active Object structure.">QActive</a> structure. I'll have more to say about this in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(12-14) These functions perform an early initialization of the active objects in the system. They play the role of static "constructors", which in C you need to call explicitly, typically at the beginning of main() (see also <a class="el" href="main_function.html#L3s1">Listing 3-1</a>(10-12)).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="generating"></a>
6.2 Generating, Posting, and Publishing Events</h2>
<p>The QF framework supports two types of asynchronous event exchange:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The simple mechanism of direct event posting supported through the functions <a class="el" href="qf_8h.html#a39bfd1c186beaf9c9000f14bcc258e5b" title="Posts an event e directly to the event queue of the acitve object me using the First-In-First-Out (FI...">QActive_postFIFO()</a> and <a class="el" href="qf_8h.html#a27984f6494cd1698adce6f8b957ad6c3" title="Posts an event directly to the event queue of the active object me using the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)...">QActive_postLIFO()</a>, where the producer of an event directly posts the event to the event queue of the consumer active object.</li>
<li>A more sophisticated publish-subscribe event delivery mechanism supported through the functions <a class="el" href="qf_8h.html#a569a926df9b5180cd9e03b0c9f78adcf" title="Publish event to the framework.">QF_publish()</a> and <a class="el" href="qf_8h.html#a2cb9015d643ddbf487112dfefb02eef3" title="Subscribes for delivery of signal sig to the active object me.">QActive_subscribe()</a>, where the producers of the events "publish" them to the framework, and the framework then delivers the events to all active objects that had "subscribed" to these events.</li>
</ol>
<p>In QF, any part of the system can produce events, not necessarily only the active objects. For example, interrupt service routines (ISRs) or device drivers can also produce events. On the other hand, only active objects can consume events, because only active objects have event queues.</p>
<dl class="note"><dt><b>Note:</b></dt><dd>QF also provides "raw" thread-safe event queues (struct <a class="el" href="struct_q_e_queue.html" title="Native QF Event Queue.">QEQueue</a>), which can consume events as well. These "raw" thread-safe queues cannot block and are intended to deliver events to ISRs or device drivers. Please refer to Chapter 7 of <a class="el" href="index.html#PSiCC2">Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, Second Edition</a> for more details.</dd></dl>
<p>The most important characteristic of event management in QF is that the framework passes around only pointers to events, not the events themselves. QF never copies the events by value ("zero-copy" policy); even in case of publishing events that often involves multicasting the same event to multiple subscribers. The actual event instances are either constant events statically allocated at compile time, or dynamic events allocated at runtime from one of the event pools that the framework manages. <a class="el" href="events.html#L6s2">Listing 6-2</a> provides examples of publishing static events and posting dynamic events from the interrupt service routines (ISRs) of the "Fly 'n' Shoot" version for the ARM-Cortex board (file <code>&lt;qpc&gt;\examples\arm-cortex\vanilla\iar\game-ev-lm3s811\bsp.c</code>). In the upcoming Section <a class="el" href="coding_hsm.html">7. Coding Hierarchical State Machines</a> you will see other examples of event posting from active objects in the state machine code.</p>

Some active objects in the system might still be referring to the event via a pointer, so the event should not be changing.
